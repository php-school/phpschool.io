As usual a major release of PHP comes with a variety of improvements to the language that developers can immediately benefit from without having to learn anything new, unfortunately it‚Äôs hard to incorporate these into a workshop as many don‚Äôt change the way you code

## How to Get Started

install instructions etc [Aydin]

## What to Expect

Once you‚Äôve got the PHP 8 Appreciate workshop installed then running `php8appreciate` will (assuming all things have gone to plan) present you with a menu of 13 exercises to choose from.

These exercises have been put in an order we believe increases in difficulty as you go along. Don‚Äôt worry though some things may click easier than others!

From this point you can select any exercise, read the problem (along with any hints and tips) and try to put together your own solution.
