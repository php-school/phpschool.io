                <p>Welcome to PHP School! A dedicated community based learning platform that will teach you the core skills in PHP. The concept behind PHP School is small standalone workshops, workshops are run from the command line, somewhere every developer should be familiar with.</p>
                <p>Each workshop covers a different topic, some beginner, some advanced. You're not restricted to a schedule, you go at your own pace with no pressure.</p>

                <p>In order to get started with PHP School workshops, you first need to install the workshop manager. Before we can do this we need to check you have a few things:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You will need PHP with a version of at least 7.1 although we recommend using the <a href="https://secure.php.net/releases/">latest available.</a></li>
                    <li>You will also need a Text Editor so you can work through the workshops. You can try <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a> or <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime</a> if you don't already have one.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Once the above are satisfied, run the following commands in your terminal, to install the workshop manager. The final command will verify your installation and will give you tips on how to resolve any issues.</p>
